<p>The speed of learning will depend on the way you formulate the
material. The same material can be learned many times faster if well formulated! The
difference in speed can be stunning!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rules are listed in the order of importance. Those listed first
are most often violated or bring most benefit if complied with!</p>

<p>There is an underlying assumption that you will proceed with
learning using spaced repetition, i.e. you will not just learn once but you will repeat
the material optimally (as in <a href="../english/smintro.htm">SuperMemo</a>).</p>

<p><big><big><strong>The 20 rules of formulating knowledge in learning</strong></big></big>

<ol>
  <li><a name="Do not learn if you do not understand"><strong><font size="4">Do
    not learn if you do not understand</font></strong></a><p><font size="3">Trying
    to learn things you do not understand may seem like an utmost nonsense. Still, an amazing
    proportion of students commit the offence of learning without comprehension. Very often they have no other
    choice! The quality of many textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination
    deadlines are unmovable. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If you
    are not a speaker of German, it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German.
    The book can be crammed word for word. However, the time needed for such
    &quot;blind learning&quot; is astronomical. Even more important: The value
    of such knowledge is negligible. If you cram a German book on history, you
    will still know nothing of history.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The German history book example is an extreme. However,
    the materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to
    blame yourself for lack of comprehension. Soon you may pollute your learning
    process with a great deal of useless material that treacherously makes you
    believe &quot;it will be useful some day&quot;. &nbsp;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="Learn before you memorize"><strong><font size="4">Learn before you
    memorize</font></strong></a><p><font size="3">Before you proceed with
    memorizing individual facts and rules, you need to <strong>build an overall picture of
    the learned knowledge</strong>. Only when individual pieces fit to build a single
    coherent structure, will you be able to dramatically reduce the learning time. This is
    closely related to the problem comprehension mentioned in <a
    href="20rules.htm#Do not learn if you do not understand">Rule 1: Do not learn if you do
    not understand</a>. A single separated piece of your picture is like a single German word
    in the textbook of history.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Do not start from memorizing loosely related facts! First
    read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g. <em>the principles of the
    internal combustion engine</em>). Only then proceed with learning using individual
    questions and answers (e.g. <em>What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?</em>),
    etc. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="Build upon the basics"><strong><font size="4">Build upon the
    basics</font></strong></a><p><font size="3">The picture of the learned whole
    (as discussed in <a href="20rules.htm#Learn before you memorize">Rule 2: Learn before you
    memorize</a>) does not have to be complete to the last detail. Just the opposite, the
    simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better.
    Simple models are easier to comprehend and encompass. You can always build upon them later
    on.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Do not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious
    things is not a waste of time! Basics may also appear volatile and the cost
    of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe side. Remember that usually you spend 50% of your time
    repeating just 3-5% of the learned material [<a href="theory.htm">source</a>]! Basics are
    usually easy to retain and take a microscopic proportion of your time. However, each
    memory lapse on basics can cost you dearly!</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><font size="4" color="#000000">Stick to the <a
    name="minimum information principle">minimum information principle</a></font></strong><p><font
    size="3">The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is
    only possible. Simplicity does not have to imply losing information and skipping the
    difficult part. Simplicity is imperative due to the way the brain works. There
    are two main
    reasons for which knowledge must be simple:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><font size="3">Simple is easy</font></strong><font size="3"><br>
          By definition, simple material is easy to remember. This comes from the fact that its
          simplicity makes is easy for the brain to process it always in the same way. Imagine a
          labyrinth. When making a repetition of a piece of material, your brain is running through
          a labyrinth (you can view a neural network as a tangle of paths). While running through
          the labyrinth, the brain leaves a track on the walls. If it can run in only one unique
          way, the path is continuous and easy to follow. If there are many combinations, each run
          may leave a different trace that will interfere with other traces making it difficult to
          find the exit. The same happens on the cellular level with different synaptic connections
          being activated at each repetition of complex material</font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><font size="3">Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule</font></strong><font size="3"><br>
          I assume you will make repetitions of the learned material using optimum inter-repetition
          intervals (as in <a href="../english/smintro.htm">SuperMemo</a>). If you consider an item
          that is composed of two sub-items, you will need to make repetitions that are frequent
          enough to keep the more difficult item in memory. If you split the complex item into
          sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace saving your time. Very often, inexperienced
          students create items that could easily be split into <b> ten or more</b> simpler
          sub-items!
          Although the number of items increases, the number of repetitions of each item will
          usually be small enough to greatly outweigh the cost of (1) forgetting the complex item
          again and again, (2) repeating it in excessively short intervals or (3) actually
          remembering it only in part!</font></li>
      </ul>

    </center></div><p><font size="3">You might want to experiment and try to
    learn two subjects using the two above approaches and see for yourself what advantage is
    brought by minimum information principle. This is particularly visible in the long
    perspective, i.e. <strong>the longer the time you need to remember
    knowledge, the more you benefit from simplifying your
    items</strong>!</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Note in the example above how short the questions are. Note
    also that the answers are even shorter! We want a minimum amount of information to
    be retrieved from memory in a single repetition! <b>We want answer to be as
    short as imaginably possible</b>!</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">You will notice that the knowledge learned in the
    ill-structured example is not entirely equivalent to the well-structured formulation. For
    example, although you will remember why the Dead Sea can keep swimmers afloat, you may
    forget that it at all has such a characteristic in the first place! Additionally, rounding
    396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information. These can be remedied by adding
    more questions or making the present ones more precise. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">You will also lose the ability to fluently recite
    the description of the Dead Sea when called up to the blackboard by your teachers. I bet,
    however, that shining in front of the class is not your ultimate goal in learning. To see
    how to cope with recitations and poems, read further (section devoted to <a

  <li><a name="Use imagery"><strong><font size="4">Use imagery</font></strong></a><p>Visual cortex is that part of the brain in which visual stimuli are
    interpreted. It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we
    say <em>one picture is worth a thousand words</em>. Indeed if you look at the number of
    details kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them, you
    will notice that our verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the
    visual processing power. The same refers to memory. A graphic representation of
    information is usually far less volatile.</p>
    <p>Usually it takes much less time to formulate a simple
    question-and-answer pair than to find or produce a neat graphic image. This is why you
    will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using graphics in your learning
    material. Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as
    anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more.</p>
    <p>The power of imagery explains why the concept of Tony Buzan's mind
    maps is so popular. A mind map is an abstract picture in which connections between its
    components reflect the logical connections between individual concepts.</p>

    techniques</a></font></strong><p><font size="3">Mnemonic techniques are various techniques that make
    remembering easier. They are often amazingly effective. For most students, a picture of a
    10-year-old memorizing a sequence of 50 playing cards verges on discovering a young
    genius. It is very surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that
    make it possible with a dose of training. These techniques are available to everyone and
    do not require any special skills!</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Before you start believing that mastering such techniques
    will provide you with an eternal solution to the problem of forgetting, be warned that the
    true bottleneck towards long-lasting and useful memories is not in quickly memorizing
    knowledge! This is indeed the easier part. The bottleneck lies in retaining memories for
    months, years or for lifetime! To accomplish the latter you will need <a
    href="../english/smintro.htm">SuperMemo</a>  and the compliance with the 20
    rules presented herein.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There have been dozens of books written about mnemonic
    techniques. Probably those written by Tony Buzan are most popular and respected. You can
    search the web for keywords such as: <em>mind maps, peg lists</em>, <em>mnemonic
    techniques</em>, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Experience shows that with a dose of training you will need
    to consciously apply mnemonic techniques in only 1-5% of your items. With time, using
    mnemonic techniques will become automatic!</font></p>

    works like <a href="20rules.htm#Cloze deletion">cloze deletion</a> but instead of a
    missing phrase it uses a missing image component. For example, when learning anatomy, you
    might present a complex illustration. Only a small part of it would be missing. The
    student's job is to name the missing area. The same illustration can be used to formulate
    10-20 items! Each item can ask about a specific subcomponent of the image. Graphic
    deletion works great in learning geography!</font></p>

  <li><a name="Avoid sets"><strong><font size="4">Avoid sets</font></strong></a><p>A
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set">set</a> is a collection of
    objects. For example, a set of fruits might be an apple, a pear and a peach.
    A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks
    for the list of the members of a set.<font
    size="3"> For example: <em>What countries
    belong to the European Union?</em> You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost
    of retaining memories based on sets. If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always
    try to convert them into <a href="20rules.htm#Enumerations">enumerations</a>. Enumerations
    are ordered lists of members (for example, the alphabetical list of the members of the
    EU). Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided. However, the
    great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the
    brain to list them always in the same order. An ordered list of countries contains more
    information than the set of countries that can be listed in any order. Paradoxically, despite containing more information, enumerations are easier to
    remember. The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context of the <a
    href="20rules.htm#minimum information principle">minimum information principle</a>: <strong>you
    should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition</strong>.
    In the case of sets, listing members in varying order at each repetition has a disastrous
    effect on memory. It is nearly impossible to memorize sets containing more than five
    members without the use of mnemonic techniques, enumeration, grouping, etc. Despite this
    claim, you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques that help you go
    around this problem. Those techniques, however, will fail you all too often.
    For that reason: <strong>Avoid sets! </strong>If
    you need them badly, convert them into enumerations and use <a
    href="#Enumerations">techniques for dealing with enumerations</a></font></p>

    15-member set into 9 items, five of which are 2-3 member sets, and one is a six member
    enumeration. Put it to your SuperMemo, and see how easy it is to generate the list
    of the European Union members using the historic timeline! Note the tricks used with France and the
    UK. They joined the union in the company of others but have been listed as separate
    items to simplify the learning process. Note
    also that the sum of information included in this well-formulated approach is
    far greater than that of the original set. Thus along simplicity, we gained
    some useful knowledge. All individual items effectively comply with the <a
    href="20rules.htm#minimum information principle">minimum information principle</a>! You
    could go further by trying to split the Germany-Italy-Benelux set or using mnemonic
    techniques to memorize the final seven-member enumeration (i.e. the last of
    the questions above). However, you should take those steps only if you have any problems with retaining the
    proposed set in memory.</p>

    learn. They are still far more acceptable than sets. Avoid enumerations wherever you can.
    If you cannot avoid them, deal with them using <a href="20rules.htm#Cloze deletion">cloze
    deletions</a> (overlapping cloze deletions if possible). Learning the alphabet can be a
    good example of an overlapping cloze deletion:</font></p>

    </table>
    </center></div><p><font size="3">The above items will make learning the
    alphabet much faster. The greatest advantage of the above approach is that is it easier
    for psychological reasons: the student does not have to stop repetitions to recite the
    whole sequence and can only focus on a small part of the learned material. Still it is
    recommended that he recite the whole alphabet <strong>after</strong> making the
    repetition. However, once all individual pieces are well remembered, reciting the whole
    should be a pleasant and speedy action that produces little frustration.<br>
    The cloze deletion used above is an overlapping cloze deletion, i.e. the same parts of the
    enumeration are strengthened in memory using different items (for example, the sequence
    C-D will be needed to recall the second and the third item). This redundancy does not
    contradict the <a href="20rules.htm#minimum information principle">minimum information
    principle</a> because <strong>the extra information is added in extra items</strong>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">You can also deal with enumerations by using grouping like in the case of sets
    (see the <a href="20rules.htm#EEC">European Union example</a>) but cloze deletions should be simpler
    and should suffice in most cases.<br>
    Learning poems is an example of learning enumerations (all words and sentences have to be
    uttered in a predefined sequence); however, due to strong semantic connections, the rhyme
    and the rhythm, it may often be possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze
    deletion and without the frustration of forgetting small subcomponents again and again.
    However, once you notice you stumble with your poem, you should dismember it using cloze
    deletion and thus make sure that the learning is fast, easy, effective and pleasurable</font></p>

    size="3">When you learn about similar things you often confuse them. For
    example, you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the words <em>historic
    </em>and <em>historical</em>. This will even be more visible if you memorize lots of
    numbers, e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy. If knowledge of one item makes
    it harder to remember another item, we have a case of <strong>memory interference</strong>.
    You can often remember an item for years with straight excellent grades until ... you
    memorize another item that makes it nearly impossible to remember either! For example,
    if you learn geography and you memorize that the country located between Venezuela,
    Suriname and Brazil is Guyana, you are likely to easily recall this fact for years with
    just a couple of repetitions. However, once you add similar items asking about the
    location of all these countries, and French Guyana, and Colombia and more, you will
    suddenly notice strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting.
    In simple terms: you will get confused about what is what.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Interference is probably the single greatest cause of
    forgetting in collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo. You can never be sure when
    it strikes, and the only hermetic procedure against it is to <strong>detect and
    eliminate</strong>. In other words, in many cases it may be impossible to predict
    interference at the moment of formulating knowledge. Interference can also occur between
    remotely related items like Guyana, Guyard and </font>Guyenne, as well as Guyana, kayman
    and ... aspirin. It may work differently for you and for your colleague. It
    very hard to predict.</p>
    <p>Still you should do your best to prevent interference before it
    takes its toll. This will make your learning process less stressful and mentally bearable.

    There is no risk of irrelevant emotional state in this example as the state helps to

    was forgotten 20 times within one year, while the same item with a subtle
    interference-busting example was not forgotten even once in ten repetitions spread over
    five years. This is roughly equivalent to <strong>25-fold saving in time in the period of

    clearly label subcategories (e.g. with strings such as <em>chem</em> for <em>chemistry</em>,
    <em>math</em> for <em>mathematics</em>, etc.). This will help you simplify the
    wording of your items as you will be relieved from the need to specify the context of
    your question. In the example below, the well-defined prefix <em>bioch: </em>saves you a lot of
    typing and a lot of reading while still making sure you do not confuse the abbreviation
    GRE with Graduate Record Examination. Note that in the recommended case, you process the
    item starting from the label <em>bioch</em> which puts your brain immediately in the right
    context. While processing the lesser optimum case, you will waste precious milliseconds on

      <li><strong><font size="3">passive and active approach</font></strong><font size="3">: if you learn a

      <li><strong>reasoning cues</strong>: you will often want to boost your
        reasoning ability by asking about a solution to the problem. Instead of just <em>memorizing</em>
        the answer you would like to quickly follow the reasoning steps (e.g. solve a simple
        mathematical equation) and <em>generate</em> the answer. In such a case, providing the
        hint on the reasoning steps in the answer will only serve helping you always follow the
        right path at repetitions</li>
      <li><strong><font size="3">derivation steps</font></strong><font size="3">: in more complex problems
        to solve, memorizing individual derivation steps is always highly recommended (e.g.
        solving complex mathematical problems). It is not cramming! It is making sure that the
        brain can always follow the fastest path while solving the problem. For more on boosting
        creativity and intelligence read: <a href="genius.htm">Roots of genius
        and creativity</a>, as well as more specific: <a href="../english/ol/ks.htm#Intelligence">Derivation,
        reasoning and intelligence</a></font></li>
      <li><strong><font size="3">multiple semantic representation</font></strong><font size="3">: very
        often the same knowledge can be represented and viewed from different angles. Memorizing
        different representations of the same fact or rule is recommended in cases where a given
        memory is of high value. This will increase the expected recall rate
        (beyond that specified with the <a href="../help/fi.htm">forgetting
        index</a>)!</font></li>
      <li><strong><font size="3">flexible repetition</font></strong><font size="3">: if there are
        many valid responses to the same question make sure that your representation makes it
        possible to identify the equivalence and reward you with good grades by providing
        just one
        of the equivalent choices. For example, if you learn a language, it rarely make sense to
        learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept. It is more adequate to consider a
        single synonym as the sufficient answer (e.g. <em>a mark made by ink spilt on sth</em> =
        </font><em>blot/blob/blotch</em>)</li>
      <li><a href="../english/ol/ks.htm#Redundancy"><font size="3">more</font></a></li>

  <li><strong><font size="4">Provide <a name="sources">sources</a></font></strong><p><font
    size="3">Except for well-tested and proven knowledge (such as <em>2+2=4</em>),
    it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your
    knowledge. In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your
    knowledge. Sources can come to your rescue. You will also find that facts and figures
    differ depending on the source. You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable
    information agencies publish figures that are drastically different from other equally
    reputable sources. Without SuperMemo, those discrepancies are often difficult to notice:
    before you encounter
    the new fact, the old one is often long forgotten. With sources provided, you will be
    able to make more educated choices on which pieces of information are more reliable.
    Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g. <i>Watch out!, Other
    sources differ!</i>, etc.). Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge
    (unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever asked).</font></p>

  <li><strong><font size="4">Provide <a name="date stamping">date stamping</a></font></strong><p><font
    size="3">Knowledge can be relatively stable (basic math, anatomy, taxonomy,
    physical geography, etc.) and highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech knowledge,
    personal statistics, etc.). It is important that you provide your items with time stamping
    or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence. In case of statistical figures, you
    might stamp them with the year they have been collected. When learning software applications, it is
    enough you stamp the item with the software version. Once you have newer figures you can
    update your items. Unfortunately, in most cases you will have to re-memorize
    knowledge that became outdated. Date stamping is useful in
    editing and verifying your knowledge; however, you will rarely want to memorize stamping
    itself. If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time (e.g. GNP
    figures over a number of years), the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself.</font></p>

  <li><a name="Prioritize"><strong><font size="4">Prioritize</font></strong></a><p><font
    size="3">You will always face far more knowledge that you
    will be able to master. That is why prioritizing is critical for building quality
    knowledge in the long-term. The way you prioritize will affect the way your
    knowledge slots in. This will also affect the speed of learning (e.g. see: <a href="#Build upon the basics">learn
    basics first</a>). There are many stages at which prioritizing will take place;
    only few are relevant to knowledge representation, but all are important:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li><strong><font size="3">Prioritizing sources </font> </strong><font size="3">- there will always be
          a number of sources of your knowledge. If you are still at student years: these will most
          likely be books and notes pertaining to different subjects. Otherwise you will probably
          rely more on journals, Internet, TV, newspapers, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. It is
          always worth being aware what is the optimum proportion of time devoted to those varied
          sources. As you progress with learning, you will quickly develop a good sense of which
          learning slots bring better results and which might be extended at the cost of others</font></li>
        <li><strong><font size="3">Extracting knowledge </font> </strong><font size="3">- unless you are about
          to pass an important exam, it nearly never makes sense to memorize whole books or whole
          articles. You will need to extract those parts that are most likely to impact the
          quality of your knowledge. You can do it by (1) marking paragraphs in a book or journal,
          (2) pasting relevant web pages to SuperMemo, (3) pasting relevant passages
          to SuperMemo, (4) typing facts and figures directly to SuperMemo
          notes,
          etc. You will need some experience before you can accurately measure how much knowledge
          you can indeed transfer to your brain and what degree of detail you
          can feasibly master. Your best way to prioritize the flow of knowledge
          into your memory is to use <a href="../help/read.htm">incremental
          reading</a> tools</font></li>
        <li><strong><font size="3">Transferring knowledge to SuperMemo </font> </strong><font size="3">- you
          may try to stick with the 20 rules of formulating knowledge at the moment of introducing
          your material to SuperMemo. However, you can also literally transfer your notes or import
          whole files and later use the mechanisms provided by SuperMemo to determine the order of
          processing the imported material. Probably the best criterion for choosing between
          formulating or just importing is the time needed for accurately formulating the item or
          items. If formulation requires more knowledge, more time, comparing with other sources,
          etc. you can just import. Otherwise, if you believe that formulating an accurate item is a
          matter of seconds, formulate it</font></li>
        <li><strong><font size="3">Formulating items </font> </strong><font size="3">- make sure that
          explanatory or optional components of the answer are placed in the parentheses so that
          your attention is focused on the most important part of the item. The parts in the
          parentheses can be read after the repetition to strengthen the memory in its context</font></li>
        <li><strong><font size="3">Using forgetting index </font> </strong><font size="3">- you can use the <a
          href="../help/fi.htm">forgetting index</a> to prioritize pending items. The sequence of

          retention level for items that are more important and lower retention level for items of
          lower priority</font></li>
        <li><strong><font size="3">Learning </font> </strong><font size="3">- the process of prioritizing does
          not end with the onset of repetitions. Here are the tools you can use to continue setting

              will be able to determine the next interval for the currently reviewed item (its

<p>Here again are the twenty rules of formulating knowledge. You will
notice that the first 16 rules revolve around making memories simple! Some of the rules
strongly overlap. For example: <strong>do not learn if you do not understand</strong> is a
form of applying the <strong>minimum information principle</strong> which again is a way
of making things simple:

<ol>
  <li><a href="20rules.htm#Do not learn if you do not understand"><strong>Do
    not learn if you do not understand</strong></a></li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Learn before you memorize">Learn before
    you memorize</a> </strong>- build the picture of the whole before you dismember it into
    simple items in SuperMemo. If the whole shows holes, review it again!</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Build upon the basics">Build upon the
    basics</a> </strong>- never jump both feet into a complex manual because you may never see
    the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily fit
    in</li>
  <li><a href="20rules.htm#minimum information principle"><strong>Stick to
    the minimum information principle</strong></a> - if you continue forgetting an item, try
    to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze
    deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Cloze deletion">Cloze deletion is easy
    and effective</a> </strong>- completing a deleted word or phrase is not only an effective
    way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulating knowledge and is highly
    recommended for beginners</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Use imagery">Use imagery</a> </strong>-
    a picture is worth a thousand words</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#mnemonic techniques">Use mnemonic
    techniques</a> </strong>- read about peg lists and mind maps. Study the books by Tony
    Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures.
    You won't have problems with phone numbers and complex figures</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Graphic deletion">Graphic deletion is as
    good as cloze deletion</a> </strong>- obstructing parts of a picture is great for learning
    anatomy, geography and more</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Avoid sets">Avoid sets</a> </strong>- larger sets are virtually
    un-memorizable unless you convert them into enumerations!</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Enumerations">Avoid enumerations</a> </strong>-
    enumerations are also hard to remember but can be dealt with using cloze deletion</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Interference">Combat interference</a> </strong>-
    even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items.
    Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal
    life</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Optimize wording">Optimize wording</a> </strong>-
    like you reduce mathematical equations, you can reduce complex sentences into smart,
    compact and enjoyable maxims</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Refer to other memories">Refer to other
    memories</a> </strong>- building memories on other memories generates a coherent and
    hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics and use
    planned redundancy to fill in the gaps</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Personalize and provide examples">Personalize
    and provide examples</a> </strong>- personalization might be the most effective way of
    building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to
    refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to
    build upon well established memories</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Rely on emotional states">Rely on
    emotional states</a> </strong>- emotions are related to memories. If you learn a fact in
    the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some memories
    can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#Context cues">Context cues simplify
    wording</a> </strong>- providing context is a way of simplifying memories, building upon
    earlier knowledge and avoiding interference</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#Redundancy">Redundancy does not
    contradict minimum information principle</a> </strong>- some forms of redundancy are
    welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from different angles.
    Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs. Memorizing
    derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your
    intellectual powers!</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#sources">Provide sources</a> </strong>-
    sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its
    reliability, or importance</li>
  <li><strong><a href="20rules.htm#date stamping">Provide date stamping</a>
    </strong>- time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge that changes in
    time</li>
  <li><a href="20rules.htm#Prioritize"><strong>Prioritize</strong></a> -
    effective learning is all about prioritizing. In <i>incremental</i><i>
    reading</i> you can start from badly formulated knowledge and improve its
    shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of
    inappropriate formulation). If need be, you can review pieces of knowledge
    again,
    split it into parts, reformulate, reprioritize, or delete. See also: <a href="../help/read.htm">Incremental
